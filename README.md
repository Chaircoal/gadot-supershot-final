Gadot 3D Shooter/Platformer - 2020

Made in 2020 with a 3 person team to develop Gadot and Blender skills in a limited time frame (~5 weeks).
Personal Contributions: 3D models/animations, level design, Blender/Sound integration, with pair programming for functions and physics. 

Unzip file, .pck and .exe should be in the same folder.

Tutorial will go over basic controls:
- WASD movement
- Left mouse button to shoot (Shooting downwards will propel player up)

IMPORTANT: The player can boost upwards 2 times midair before needing to touch the ground to 'recharge'.

My first attempt at proper game design, so screen formatting may not work as intended on all devices.
